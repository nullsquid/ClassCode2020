# GDP-112 Intro Game Programming
_Course Taught at Union County College, Spring 2020
Taught by Hyacinth Nil Ramsay_
This course is taught in 2 parts: beginning with an introduction to game programming concepts in 2d using the very lovely framework [LoVE 2D](love2d.org) and then moving to 3D game development in [Unity](unity.com). This document will be updated as I (the instructor) have time and energy.
